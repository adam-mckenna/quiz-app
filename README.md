# University Challenge style quiz app

This project is a rapidly built Angular and Tailwind prototype for a [University Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Challenge) style quiz app that I built to play with friends.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
